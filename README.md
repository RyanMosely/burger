## Conclusion

This assignment was a good meditation on how Handlebars works as a web template system. The main thing that I learned most about is how the controller,views, model, and orm works together. The modularizatoin for each section really helps make sense of how the data interacts with the table set up in the database, each actions is literally split up into different js pages, which honestly helps me make sense of things. I'm excited to implement this kind of modularzation stucture in future projects. I think what will make my project stand out the most is the design of my website! It's kind of close to the youtube example, but with some differences.
